  publisher: 'Publisher named GCN', // Organization name used for SEO schema
  siteDescription:

```

### Theme

Edit `/src/styles/theme.js`

```js
const theme = {
  colors: {
    base: '#121212',
    secondary: '#e9e9e9',
    tertiary: '#f3f3f3',
    highlight: '#5b8bf7',
  },
  sizes: {
    maxWidth: '1200px',
    maxWidthCentered: '650px',
  },
  responsive: {
    small: '35em',
    medium: '50em',
    large: '70em',
  },
}
```

### Using Gatsby Standard

1.  Quickly check your code for errors with the `npm test` script
2.  You can view the [Gatsby Standard README](https://github.com/brandonkal/eslint-config-gatsby-standard) for details on how to integrate this project's included Gatsby Standard, Stylelint, and Prettier modules into your text editor

### Content and SEO

1.  You can replace the `share.jpg` and `logo-512` files in the `static/logos` directory. After replacing these files ensure that you edit the image size dimensions specified in `/src/utils/siteConfig.js`
2.  Meta descriptions are defined in Contentful. If you choose to leave this field blank on new posts a 130 character excerpt of the post/page will be used.

## Deployment

### Manual Netlify Deployment

1.  Run `gatsby build`

2.  Drag and drop the folder `/public/` into Netlify

### Netlify Deployment From Git (Recommended)

1.  [New Netlify website from Git](https://app.netlify.com/start)

2.  Connect with GitHub and select your repo

3.  Navigate to Netlify: **Settings** → **Build & Deploy** → **Build Environment Variables**. Add the following environment variables using the space id and production access token from Contentful. They must be named exactly like this in order to work properly.

```
ACCESS_TOKEN
SPACE_ID
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS
```

4.  Navigate to Netlify: **Deploys**. Click `Trigger deploy` to manually trigger a deploy to confirm the website is building successfully using your build environment variables. At this point be aware that every time you push to `master` a deploy will automatically start and be published to production.

## Additional Settings

### Contentful Webhook (Optional)

1.  Navigate to Netlify:
    **Settings** → **Build & Deploy** → **Build hooks**.
    Create a new build hook.

2.  Navigate to Contentful:
    **app.contentful.com** → **Space Settings** → **Webhooks**. Create a webhook using the Netlify build URL that you just created
    and configure which events should trigger the build on production. For example the following will rebuild the production website every time a post or page is published, unpublished or deleted:

### Netlify Form Notifications (Optional)

1.  Navigate to Netlify:
    **Forms** → **Notifications**

2.  Click the add notification dropdown and select your desired notification method.

## Useful Tips

* If you make edits to your Contentful space while running `gatsby develop` you will need to stop it and rerun the command to see the changes reflected. For example a new post or page will not automatically show up until the website has been rebuilt.
* If your website fails to build check that you have at least **one page**, **one post** and **one tag** in Contentful. In addition, at least **one page** and **one post** must have a defined **meta description** in Contentful.
* **DO NOT** store your Contentful access tokens or space ids anywhere in GitHub. Treat them like passwords.
